        <h1>Journal</h1>
        <h2 class="journal-week">Week 1 (Started May 21)</h2>
        <p>
            Professor Gini and John Harwell were at a conference, so I was given two weeks to look into <a href="https://www.argos-sim.info/index.php">Argos</a> and install it on my computer, and learn C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            This first week was spent installing virtual machines (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> is my favorite), uninstalling virtual machines because I didn't like how much room they had on my computer, finding out about the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, installing that, and then installing Argos using the Linux subsystem.

        <h2 class="journal-week">Week 2 (May 28)</h2>
        <p>
            This was my second week on my own as both of my contacts were still at the conference, so I began to learn C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            Usually when I learn a new language, I first learn a basic "hello world" program, and then program a simple game of rock-paper-scissors with a random (or extremely bad non-random) AI, just to make sure I know the language. This time, I decided to try to create a tic-tac-toe game instead of rock-paper-scissors, because I had most recently created <a href="https://github.com/London-Lowmanstone/CS50-Final-Project">a tic-tac-toe bot</a> in Python, and thought it would be cool to see if I could create something that ran faster in C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I had learned a little C in the past year, the learning curve was high for C++. I switched from using Visual Studio back to using Atom because Visual Studio was too complicated to understand, but then eventually settled back on Visual Studio once running things in Visual Studio became easier, despite the cryptic error messages and a difficult-to-understand GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            My Google history from this week is filled with searches like "initial value of reference to non-const must be an lvalue" and "set array via constructor parameter C++" and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17771406/c-initial-value-of-reference-to-non-const-must-be-an-lvalue">visiting</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2732978/c-how-to-declare-a-struct-in-a-header-file">StackOverflow</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20988705/is-an-include-before-ifdef-define-include-guard-okay">a lot</a>.<br>
            In the end, <a href="http://www.wellho.net/mouth/2673_Multiple-Inheritance-in-C-a-complete-example.html">this site</a> ended up being the most helpful because it had a full working minimal example of include guards and subclasses, and helped me figure out a lot about how to structure my code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I eventually did get a working tic-tac-toe game, where you could make moves on the board and determine who won, but I never implemented anything better than a completely random AI, and even that was difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've found I'm very much used to Python taking care of lower-level implementation for me, and I'm not used to feeling like I'm making bad low-level decisions by implementing things in three loops rather than one, or by using a datatype twice as big as the one I need. I started focusing on the minutiae instead of the overall program, and it really bogged me down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trying to learn C++ really made me appreciate Python more.
        </p>
        <h2 class="journal-week">Week 3 (June 4th)</h2>
        <p>
            This was my first week at the U of M, meeting with my mentor and the graduate student I planned to work for. I talked to John Harwell and Professor Gini quite a bit during the first few days of this week, learning more about Argos and determining different ideas for projects I could work on.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was talking to John about his project, <a href="https://github.com/swarm-robotics/fordyca">Foraging Robots Use Dynamic Caches (FORDYCA)</a>, he mentioned that one thing that would be very helpful would be able to have a script that generated configuration files for the experiments he wanted to run and then ran all of the experiments on a supercomputer. Due to my difficulty learning C++, I thought this would be a great project for me because I could implement it in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            So on Wednesday (June 6th), I started working on the project. We called it <a href="https://github.com/swarm-robotics/sierra">Sierra, just because the name sounded nice. (Later, I would come to think of it as saving a "mountain" of work.)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            During the course of the week, I developed a class that allows you to easily edit XML files (since that is the format of Argos's configuration files). At this point, the class needed to be able to do 4 things: Open XML files, change attributes within the XML file, remove elements from the XML file, and save the XML file.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I spent a lot of time reading the documentation for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">ElementTree</a> built-in Python package, which has a lot of nice and easy functions for editing XML files.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the week I had a class that was working, and was ready to try to run experiments on the supercomputer.
        </p>
        <h2 class="journal-week">Week 4 (June 11th)</h2>
        <p>
            This was the week of MSI, the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.
        </p>
        <p>
            John recommended using GNUParallel for getting the simulations to run in parallel on MSI. So, I spent a few days looking at GNUParallel and figuring out how to get it to run in Python. The solution I came up with was to use the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html">subprocess module</a> in order to essentially run the GNUParallel commands as if I were typing them at the command line.
