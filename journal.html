        <h1>Journal</h1>
        <h2 class="journal-week">Week 1 (Started May 21)</h2>
        <p>
            Professor Gini and John Harwell were at a conference, so I was given two weeks to look into <a href="https://www.argos-sim.info/index.php">Argos</a> and install it on my computer, and learn C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            This first week was spent installing virtual machines (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> is my favorite), uninstalling virtual machines because I didn't like how much room they had on my computer, finding out about the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, installing that, and then installing Argos using the Linux subsystem.

        <h2 class="journal-week">Week 2</h2>
        <p>
            This was my second week on my own as both of my contacts were still at the conference, so I began to learn C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            Usually when I learn a new language, I first learn a basic "hello world" program, and then program a simple game of rock-paper-scissors with a random (or extremely bad non-random) AI, just to make sure I know the language. This time, I decided to try to create a tic-tac-toe game instead of rock-paper-scissors, because I had most recently created <a href="https://github.com/London-Lowmanstone/CS50-Final-Project">a tic-tac-toe bot</a> in Python, and thought it would be cool to see if I could create something that ran faster in C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I had learned a little C in the past year, the learning curve was high for C++. I switched from using Visual Studio back to using Atom because Visual Studio was too complicated to understand, but then eventually settled back on Visual Studio once running things in Visual Studio became easier, despite the cryptic error messages and a difficult-to-understand GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            My Google history from this week is filled with searches like "initial value of reference to non-const must be an lvalue" and "set array via constructor parameter C++" and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17771406/c-initial-value-of-reference-to-non-const-must-be-an-lvalue">visiting</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2732978/c-how-to-declare-a-struct-in-a-header-file">StackOverflow</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20988705/is-an-include-before-ifdef-define-include-guard-okay">a lot</a>.<br>
            In the end, <a href="http://www.wellho.net/mouth/2673_Multiple-Inheritance-in-C-a-complete-example.html">this site</a> ended up being the most helpful because it had a full working minimal example of include guards and subclasses, and helped me figure out a lot about how to structure my code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I eventually did get a working tic-tac-toe game, where you could make moves on the board and determine who won, but I never implemented anything better than a completely random AI, and even that was difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've found I'm very much used to Python taking care of lower-level implementation for me, and I'm not used to feeling like I'm making bad low-level decisions by implementing things in three loops rather than one, or by using a datatype twice as big as the one I need. I started focusing on the minutiae instead of the overall program, and it really bogged me down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trying to learn C++ really made me appreciate Python more.
